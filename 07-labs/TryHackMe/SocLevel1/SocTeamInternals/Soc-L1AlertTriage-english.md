# SOC L1 — Alert Triage (Notes)

## Objective

Understand how a Security Operations Center (SOC) Level 1 analyst manages alerts from detection to closure.

---

## What is an Alert?

An alert is a notification generated by security tools when suspicious activity is detected within system logs.

**Basic Flow:**

```
Event → Log → SIEM/EDR → Detection → Alert
```

Without alerts, analysts would need to manually review massive volumes of logs.

## Role of a SOC L1 Analyst

SOC L1 analysts serve as the first line of defense. Their primary responsibility is reviewing alerts and determining whether they represent real threats.

**Responsibilities within the SOC:**

* **L1 Analyst:** Reviews alerts and escalates critical incidents.
* **L2 Analyst:** Conducts deeper investigations and performs remediation.
* **Security Engineers:** Configure detection rules and improve alert quality.
* **SOC Manager:** Oversees triage efficiency and operational quality.

## Key Alert Properties

Before starting an investigation, it is essential to understand the main alert fields:

* **Alert Time:** When the event occurred.
* **Alert Name:** Type of detected activity.
* **Severity:** Risk level (Low → Critical).
* **Status:** New, In Progress, Closed.
* **Verdict:** True Positive or False Positive.
* **Assignee:** Person responsible for the alert.
* **Description:** Context about the event.
* **Additional Fields:** Technical data for deeper analysis.

---

## Alert Prioritization

When handling a high volume of alerts:

1. Focus on newly generated alerts.
2. Sort by severity (Critical first).
3. Address the oldest alerts before newer ones.

Higher-severity alerts typically have a greater likelihood of representing real threats.

## Alert Triage Process

### Initial Actions

* Assign the alert to yourself.
* Change the status to **In Progress**.
* Review the alert name, description, and indicators.

---

### Investigation (Core Phase)

Recommended practices:

* Identify what asset is at risk (user, host, network, etc.).
* Understand the suspicious activity.
* Review events occurring before and after the alert.
* Validate findings using threat intelligence sources.

Many organizations rely on **playbooks** or **runbooks** to standardize investigations and improve response consistency.

---

### Final Actions

Determine whether the alert is:

* **True Positive:** A legitimate security threat.
* **False Positive:** Benign activity incorrectly flagged as malicious.

Document the investigation clearly and close the alert according to procedures.

## Key Takeaway

Correctly identifying a threat is only the beginning. Consistent practice, clear documentation, and adherence to escalation procedures are essential for becoming an effective SOC analyst.
