Reference:
https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security

## Why I chose this roadmap
I selected this roadmap because it provides a structured path covering
networking, operating systems, security fundamentals and hands-on projects.

## Key Areas I Will Focus On
- Networking
- Linux / Windows
- Python & Bash
- Security fundamentals
- Detection & analysis
- Hands-on labs

## My Strategy
I am not trying to learn everything at once.
My focus is building strong foundations first, then moving into labs and real-world projects.

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Networking basics
- [ ] Linux administration
- [ ] Python for security
- [ ] Security fundamentals
- [ ] TryHackMe path
- [ ] Build first security project
